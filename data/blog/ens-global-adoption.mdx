The internet did not take the world by storm until it was easy to use.
It took time and development to switch from searching _142.250.183.46_ to _google.com_.
Like the internet, web3 is making the switch from machine-friendly addresses
like _0xb4ab2…2391_ to human-readable usernames like _slobo.eth_ with the help of [ENS](https://docs.ens.domains/).

Historically, worldwide adoption of ENS domains has been infeasible.
Traditional ENS domains face challenges that make them inaccessible to many.
However, new blockchain developments, paired with the services of NameStone, have made
it possible to issue gasless ENS names to everyone.

## Challenges of Traditional ENS

Traditional on-chain ENS names can be expensive to own. The gas fees required to register,
edit, and renew a name each year make it inaccessible to many around the world.
In addition to pricey gas fees, if all 8 billion of us decided to register an ENS name,
it would take 33 years and consume every block on the Ethereum mainnet. The following chart depicts the estimated
cost of owning a traditional ENS name.

If we want ENS to be accessible to everyone, we need another solution.

## The Gasless Solution

Thanks to the CCIP-read standard ([ERC-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668))
and ENS wildcard resolution ([ENSIP-10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution)),
people can claim (and issue) gasless ENS names. Unlike traditional ENS domain names, CCIP-read allows data to be pulled from
off-chain sources like cloud servers, removing the need for gas fees. Coinbase has leveraged these resources to issue over 2
million gasless ENS names.

While this is significant, it would require a decent investment in engineering
resources to replicate. It took Coinbase months, if not longer, to issue gasless
subdomains to their community.

Luckily, NameStone can help you issue your own gasless subdomains in less than a day.

## NameStone: Issue Gasless Subdomains

With NameStone, **anyone** can leverage CCIP-read to issue gasless ENS subdomains to their communities.
Great examples include [PoolTogether](https://pooltogether.com/) and [ByWassies](https://www.bywassies.com/),
who used NameStone to issue ENS names to their members.

#### There are several compelling reasons for a business to consider ENS subdomains for their community:

#### Global usernames

ENS is the world’s leading domain name service. With NameStone, your community
can claim _.eth_ usernames that decentralized apps recognize around the world.

#### ENS is widely integrated

There are 100s of integrations that work with ENS names.
A few prominent examples are Rainbow Wallet, Uniswap Wallet, Mailchain, Etherscan, Metamask, and more.

#### Create shared identity

With subdomains, the parent name is the same for all
community members, allowing for quick searches and connection with one another. For example,
someone who owns _slobo.wassies.eth_ can search for _wassies.eth_ in places like social sites to
find other wassies.

#### Increased brand visibility

People change their usernames on sites like Twitter to their ENS name,
like _tim.wassies.eth_, to indicate their belonging to a group. This effect broadcasts your brand’s
name to the world.

#### Onboard web2 users

In contrast to other companies who offer user-friendly wallet creation services,
NameStone offers usernames, a term web2 users are already familiar with. Having the username _emily.nfty.eth_ instead
of _0x1ca2…1023_ makes transitioning to web3 simpler.

#### Reward loyalty

Businesses have full control over the requirements to claim subdomains.
Reward current members with early access or offer names to new users who commit to your brand
(by holding tokens, for example).
