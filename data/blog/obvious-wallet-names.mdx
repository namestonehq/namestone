This September, [Obvious](https://www.obvious.technology/) announced on Twitter/X that its
users could now claim free obv.id domains, a type of web3 username based on Ethereum Name
Service [(ENS)](https://ens.domains/), which allows long, alphanumerical wallet addresses to resolve to a shareable name. Obvious
users can use obv.id names, like “pool.obv.id," to easily send and receive funds and NFTs,
add wallets to their contact and watchlists, check their own portfolio and more.

**Why is this important?**

The integration of ENS domains into smart wallets like Obvious is vital for increasing blockchain
adoption. Without usernames, crypto transactions lack the convenience
expected from today's web experience. This acts as a barrier to entry for many, since setting up a wallet is
often the first step in one’s crypto journey. While ENS offers a solution to this, traditional
decentralized ENS names often come with high gas fees (both for users and the companies
providing them). Obvious solved this by implementing offchain usernames (similar to Coinbase
with its cb.id names), which are inherently gasless to create, edit, and manage.

**How did they do it?**

Obvious distributed obv.id usernames with [NameStone's](https://namestone.xyz) API.
