With over 2 million unique names currently registered, ENS domains, short for [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/), are best known
for replacing long, complex wallet addresses.
However, unlike traditional web2 usernames, ENS domains are much more versatile.
They can become your social identity, redirect to websites, or be used to create a blog.
So whether you’re a newcomer or blockchain veteran, this list will provide popular ways to use an ENS (sub)name.

What can you do with an ENS name?

&nbsp;

## Easily send and receive money

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We’re starting off this list with a no-brainer, given one of the main selling points for ENS
names is simplifying crypto transactions. Those familiar with crypto wallets are well
aware of how easy it is to send money to the wrong wallet address. There is no undo
button. Your money is gone forever. So, instead of giving friends a ridiculously long
wallet address like

**0x534631Bcf33BDb069fB20A93d2fdb9e4D4dD42CF**

and hoping they copy it exactly right, you can give them an ENS name instead, for
example,

**buttercup.eth**

which is much easier to send to (and check it is written correctly).

&nbsp;

## Create a social profile

Owning an ENS name means owning a username _and_ a social profile. [Coltron.eth’s
profile](https://app.ens.domains/coltron.eth) beautifully illustrates the amount of
information you can add to your name. Think of an ENS profile as a public user profile you
carry with you everywhere on the blockchain.

&nbsp;

Let's get a little more technical and learn how to fill one out.

To create a profile, you need to edit your ENS name’s text record. Every ENS name has
a text record; its job is to store information you want attached to a name.
Some people choose to display their socials, some select an avatar, and some include
other wallet addresses on other blockchains. Text records can also store information
that points to websites (which we’ll discuss later).

An important factor to consider when editing your text record is gas fees. So if you
wish to edit your text record, do so in as few transactions as possible to avoid
unnecessary fees.

If you own a gasless subdomain, gas fees do not apply to you. [Learn more
here](https://namestone.xyz/blog/ens-subdomains).

Head to the [official ENS app](https://app.ens.domains/) and connect your wallet to get
started.

&nbsp;

## Redirect to any website

ENS names can point to any website of your choice, whether you own it or not. For
instance, [https://kinglear.eth.limo/](https://kinglear.eth.limo/) uses the _kinglear.eth_
domain name along with a [limo](https://eth.limo/) proxy to redirect to Shakespeare’s King Lear (fun, right?).

To get your ENS name redirecting to the website of your choice,
[ENSRedirect](https://ensredirect.xyz/) is the tool for the job. The best part? It’s free.

&nbsp;

## Create a decentralized “link in bio”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you’ve been around social sites like Instagram for a while, you may already be familiar
with “link in bio” Linktrees—a link to a website displaying other relevant links. Turns out,
the link in bio can be your ENS name, like _yourname.eth.limo_. [sadaf.eth’s link
in bio](https://sadaf.eth.limo/) was built by 1W3, a decentralized
linktree builder.

&nbsp;

## Message with an ENS username

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

An ENS name as your messaging username—it’s the perfect fit. With a plethora of chat
apps racing to integrate ENS, _.eth_ owners have their pick of the crop when
choosing their preferred way of messaging friends.

[nftychat](https://nftychat.xyz/) is an example of a web3 Discord, which uses your ENS name to chat the
moment you sign in, relieving you of creating another username and profile.

Other messaging apps like [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet),
[ConverseApp](https://converse.xyz/), and [Lenster](https://lenster.xyz/) use
[XMTP](https://xmtp.org/docs/introduction) (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) a
protocol that allows users to “find their messages and contacts in every other app within
the XMTP network.” This means _your_ conversations are _owned by you_, and you
carry them wherever you go in the XMTP network with your wallet.

&nbsp;

## Email friends

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you can chat with your ENS name, it sure makes sense that you could email too. Whether you’re a brand seeking means of communication with on-chain
clients or someone simply seeking to attach their _.eth_ name to an email, Mailchain lets
you send emails with your ENS name. [Mailchain](https://mailchain.com/) is an email
and messaging platform that “gives you the ability to check for messages sent to any of
your blockchain addresses through your unified inbox.”

&nbsp;

## Start a decentralized blog or website

It takes two main ingredients to make a truly decentralized website or blog:
[IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) and your ENS name.

What’s a decentralized website? Unlike most of today’s websites, which rely on
centralized servers to host content, decentralized websites use peer-to-peer networking
to host content on multiple nodes or computers. IPFS is the tech behind this
peer-to-peer system of file sharing. This makes them more resistant to censorship,
since decentralized websites have no single server vulnerable to attack.

To make a blog or website, we recommend using [Planet](https://www.planetable.xyz/),
a native macOS app for building blogs and websites on IPFS and ENS. With Planet, you can
create a site and access it on your _.eth_ name. Here’s an [example](https://yihanphotos.eth.limo/)
of a photography blog.

&nbsp;

## Set your primary name

ENS names you own will always resolve to the address that claimed them, but without a
primary name, you won’t see your favorite _.eth_ name as your username when signing in
to dapps. Setting a primary name fixes that. In more technical terms, a primary name is
an ENS name that points to your wallet address and vice versa. When you set a primary
name, it appears as your username on SIWE integrated apps. Check out this article on
[how to set a primary name.](https://web3domains.com/set-your-primary-ens-name-guide/)

&nbsp;

## Create shared identity with subnames

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryCwO9Ecn.png)

Subnames (or subdomains) are created from parent domain names and can be distributed to other wallets. _tim.wassies.eth_ is
an example of a subdomain, where _tim_ is added to the domain _wassies.eth_. If you own an ENS name, there’s really no limit to the number of subnames you can
create, as long as you have the gas to manage them. Unlimited names mean unlimited possibilities for who receives them.
Plus, subnames are a cheaper alternative to registering several standard _.eth_ names.

Unlike traditional domain names, subnames can exist on-chain **or** off-chain. If they
exist off-chain, creating and editing them will cost no gas fees. Projects like [PoolTogether](https://pooltogether.com/) and
[Wassies](https://opensea.io/collection/wassiesbywassies) have given their entire community access to gasless subnames.

Among other benefits, gasless subnames can create a shared identity among a
business’s consumers. If you’re interested in learning more about issuing gasless subdomains, check out
