# Gasless DNS Setup

## Overview

With NameStone, you can create gasless ENS subdomains on your DNS domain (e.g., name.testbrand.xyz). No onchain transaction is required.

NameStone works best with Cloudflare. If you are using another registrar, we've provided instructions for connecting your domain to Cloudflare.

## 1. Connect domain to Cloudflare

[1] Login to Cloudfare or create a free account.

[2] Go to **Websites** > **Add a site.**

[3] Follow all activation steps, be sure to:

- Disable DNSSEC (if currently enabled)

- Update your domainâ€™s current nameservers to your assigned Cloudflare nameservers

## 2. Enable DNSSEC on Cloudflare

[1] Head to Cloudflare's dashboard and select your domain.

[2] Go to **DNS** > **Settings**.

[3] For DNSSEC, click **Enable DNSSEC**.

**\*Please note:** It may take up to 24 hours for DNSSEC to be enabled. Check the status [here](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/).

For additional help, visit [Cloudflare's instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/) for enabling DNSSEC.

## 3. Add a new TXT record

For Type, select **TXT**.

For Name, type an asterisk: **\***

For Content Field, copy and paste the following record. This contains NameStone's resolver:

```
ENS1 0xA87361C4E58B619c390f469B9E6F27d759715125
```
