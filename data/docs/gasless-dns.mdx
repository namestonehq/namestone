# Gasless DNS Setup

## Overview

With NameStone, you can create gasless ENS subdomains on your DNS domain (e.g., name.testbrand.xyz). No onchain transaction is required.

NameStone works best with Cloudflare. If you are using a different domain registrar, you can [transfer your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/#set-up-a-domain-transfer).

## 1. Enable DNSSEC

[1] Login to Cloudflare's dashboard and select your domain.

[2] Go to **DNS** > **Settings**.

[3] For DNSSEC, click **Enable DNSSEC**.

**\*Please note:** It may take up to 24 hours for DNSSEC to be enabled. Check the status [here](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/).

For additional help, visit [Cloudflare's instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/) for enabling DNSSEC.

## 3. Add a new TXT record

For Type, select **TXT**.

For Name, type an asterisk: **\***

For Content Field, copy and paste the following record. This contains NameStone's resolver:

```
ENS1 0xd17347fA0a6eeC89a226c96a9ae354F785e94241
```
