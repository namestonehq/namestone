# Gasless DNS Setup

## Overview

With NameStone you can create gasless ENS subnames on your DNS domain (e.g., name.testbrand.xyz). This means you can create as many subnames as you want without a single on-chain transcation.

NameStone works best with Cloudflare. If you are using a different domain registrar you can [transfer your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/#set-up-a-domain-transfer).

## 1. Turn on DNSSEC

Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account and domain.

[1] Go to DNS > Settings.

[2] For DNSSEC, click Enable DNSSEC.
