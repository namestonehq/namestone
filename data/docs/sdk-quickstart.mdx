# SDK Quickstart

We have a [typescript SDK](https://github.com/resolverworks/namestone-sdk) for users who prefer to interact with our api through typesafe methods.

Install the SDK through npm

```
npm install namestone-sdk
```

Initialize the Namestone client.

```ts
import NameStone from "namestone-sdk";

const ns = new NameStone(<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>);
```

Then call with the relevant methods.

```ts
async function getData() {
  const data = await ns.getNames();
  console.log(data);
}
```

Each of our api pages includes an SDK example and you can visit the [SDK github](https://github.com/resolverworks/namestone-sdk) for more information.
