# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [NameStone](https://namestone.com/), a service that manages the issuance of gasless ENS subdomains for projects, communities, and brands. Namestone uses a hybrid resolver, which enables the mixing of onchain and offchain records. A GUI to manage names is available via the [Admin Panel](https://namestone.com/docs/admin_panel).

Our [API](/docs/api-routes) is free to try. To get an API key, switch the ENS resolver to:

```
0xA87361C4E58B619c390f469B9E6F27d759715125
```

Fill out the [form](https://namestone.com/try-namestone) after switching the resolver to receive an API key via email.  
Or use the [enable-domain](/docs/enable-domain) endpoint.

If you are managing a DNS domain, head to [Gasless DNS](https://namestone.com/docs/gasless-dns) for setup instructions.

**Example: [namestone.eth](https://app.ens.domains/namestone.eth) on ENS app**
