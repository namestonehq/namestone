# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [NameStone](https://namestone.xyz/), a service that manages the issuance of gasless ENS subdomains for projects, communities, and brands. Namestone uses a hybrid resolver, which enables the mixing of onchain and offchain records. A GUI to manage names is available via the [Admin Panel](https://namestone.xyz/docs/admin_panel).

Our [API](/docs/api-routes) is free to try. To get an API key, switch the ENS resolver to:

```
0xd17347fA0a6eeC89a226c96a9ae354F785e94241
```

Fill out the [form](https://namestone.xyz/try-namestone) after switching the resolver to receive an API key via email.  
Or use the [enable-domain](/docs/enable-domain) endpoint.

If you are managing a DNS domain, head to [Gasless DNS](https://namestone.xyz/docs/gasless-dns) for setup instructions.

**Example: [namestone.eth](https://app.ens.domains/namestone.eth) on ENS app**
