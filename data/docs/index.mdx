# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [namestone.xyz](https://namestone.xyz/), a service that manages ENS names for projects, communities, and brands.
NameStone offers a GUI to manage names via our claim page and admin panel.

We also provide an [API](/docs/api_routes). To get an API key, switch the [ENS resolver](https://app.ens.domains/namestone.eth?tab=more) to:

```
0x2291053F49Cd008306b92f84a61c6a1bC9B5CB65
```

After switching the resolver reach out to api@namestone.xyz and an API key will be provided.

Names can be managed and issued completely gaslessly.

## \*Please Note

Although ENS writes "contentHash interface not supported" when switching resolvers, our resolver supports contentHash.

This warning can be disregarded safely.
