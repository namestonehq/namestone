# API

NameStone's API lets you grant names (subdomains), set text records, and retrieve information about domains.
To use our API, you'll need an API key for authentication.

## Get Started

Use this [form](https://namestone.com/try-namestone) to enable your domain and receive a free API key via email, or enable your name programmatically via the [enable-domain](./enable-domain) endpoint. Your domain's resolver must be set to:

```
0xA87361C4E58B619c390f469B9E6F27d759715125
```

If you are managing a DNS domain, head to [Gasless DNS](./gasless-dns) for setup instructions.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the NameStone API, you need to provide your API key in the header of your request or as a query parameter `api_key`.
